# Changes for Module::ExtractUse
#-----------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:
    - autogenerate the grammer during ./Build
    - take a look at 'use parent'

0.24    2012-02-12T14:27:36+0100
    - regenerated Grammer to work with new Parse::RecDescent
      (thanks to cpan-testers, TMUELLER, KENTNL and paul@city-fan.org
      for reporting the problem)


0.23   2008-04-26 22:14:28
    - fixed bug regarding 'use utf8' which was interpreted as 'utf'


0.22    2007-11-16
    - added 'use warnings' again to the Grammer... grr, stupid grammer
      generator


0.21    2007-11-14
    - fixed Bug reported by hanekomu via IRC:
      Modules::ExtractUse breaks if it is used with UNIVERSAL::require
      so I renamed the grammer tokens 'use' and 'require'. No API changes, 
      but if you use the grammer directly, you'll have to adapt to the new 
      names ('token_use' and 'token_reqire')


0.20    2007-11-07
    - resolved RT #30414 by applying the patch submitted by
      David Landgren
    - rearranged code to better fit my current Perl style      
    - added 'use warnings' to Module::ExtractUse::Grammer for that
      extra kwalitee point
